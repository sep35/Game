PART 1: PLAN
============


Genre
=====
I am planning to make a 2d side scroller in the vein of the original Super Mario Brothers.
The game will be a slight variation of the classic game but will be very similar to it in design. It will be based around jumping in order to avoid the obstacles that will come across the road. These obstacles will come in the form of squares and triangles that the main player will have to avoid in order to thrive and survive the dangers of the game.

Name
====
Jumpy Jacky. Jumpy Jacky follows the story of Jacky the rabbit who has to trek across a land infested by ditches, and the obstacles of the road for a rabbit. He must protect himself while making his way through all the dangers that he will be facing. Jumpy Jacky is traveling across the country to go find his beloved on the other side of the country and live with her. 


Goal
====
The goal of the game is to make it to the end of the road without falling to your death or getting stuck in a obstacle. Your sole purpose is to survive the road and make your way all the way across the different landscapes that will come across young Jacky. For example, the first level will consist of making timed jump perfectly so that you dont fall to your death on a straight road. The level ends when you reach shelter at the end of the road. The second level start after reaching shelter, and consists of you trying to jump over obstacles as well as the perishes of the road in order to increase the difficulty level of the game. Optionally the faster the level is beaten the higher the score you will record from beating the level. And there will be a running clock that will signifie a time constraint to either beat the level or otherwise meet your maker.


Basic Mechanics
===============
I intend to make it a side scroller where the main charater has the ability to jump.
The main focus of the game is to be able to make timed-jumps perfectly in order to avoid dying along the main road. You have to move forward on the road without falling to your death resulting in you not making it very far. Basically you will have to become a pro in timed jumps in order to survive the perils ahead.

Levels
======
The levels or modes differ by the kind of jumps that you have to make in order to make it to shelter. The futher you go in the levels the more jumps you will need to make to survive. Eventually you will also have to jump over square obstacles, which represents small hills or traps, to make it all the way to the end of the map into your shelter in order to stay well, alive, and away from the dangers of the wild road.
